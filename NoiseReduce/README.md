# Noise Reduction using NoiseReduce pip package. (https://pypi.org/project/noisereduce/)
https://github.com/timsainb/noisereduce

This package uses signal process algorithm based on Fast Fourier transforms to denoise the audio signal.

WARNING: The output signal is very very loud!! be careful when you play it. I'm not sure why it's so loud, need to look into it.
